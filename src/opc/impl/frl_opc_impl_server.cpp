	Add a Group to a Server.

	\param szName
		Name of the group. The name must be unique among the other groups created by this client. 
		If no name is provided (szName is pointer to a NUL string) the server will generate a unique name. 
		The server generated name will also be unique relative to any existing public groups.

	\param bActive
		FALSE if the Group is to be created as inactive. TRUE if the Group is to be created as active.

	\param dwRequestedUpdateRate
		Client Specifies the fastest rate at which data changes may be sent 
		to OnDataChange for items in this group. This also indicates the desired accuracy of Cached Data.
		This is intended only to control the behavior of the interface. 
		How the server deals with the update rate and how often it actually polls the hardware internally 
		is an implementation detail.  Passing 0 indicates the server should use the fastest practical rate. 
		The rate is specified in milliseconds.

	\param hClientGroup
		Client provided handle for this group 
		(refer to description of data types, parameters, and structures for more information about this parameter).

	\param pTimeBias
		Pointer to Long containing the initial TimeBias (in minutes) for the Group. 
		Pass a NULL Pointer if you wish the group to use the default system TimeBias. 
		See discussion of TimeBias in General Properties Section See \ref OPCServer_AddGroup_Comments "Comments" below.

	\param pPercentDeadband
		The percent change in an item value that will cause a subscription callback for that value to a client. 
		This parameter only applies to items in the group that have dwEUType of Analog.
		(See discussion of Percent Deadband in General Properties Section).
		A NULL pointer is equivalent to 0.0.

	\param dwLCID
		The language to be used by the server when returning values (including EU enumeration's) 
		as text for operations on this group. 
		This could also include such things as alarm or status conditions or digital contact states.

	\param phServerGroup
		Place to store the unique server generated handle to the newly created group.
		The client will use the server provided handle for many of the subsequent functions 
		that the client requests the server to perform on the group.

	\param pRevisedUpdateRate
		The server returns the value it will actually use for the UpdateRate which may differ from the RequestedUpdateRate. 
		Note that this may also be slower than the rate at which the server is internally obtaining the data and updating the cache. 
		In general the server should 'round up' the requested rate to the next available supported rate. 
		The rate is specified in milliseconds. 
		Server returns HRESULT of OPC_S_UNSUPPORTEDRATE when it returns
		a value in revisedUpdateRate that is different than RequestedUpdateRate.

	\param riid
		The type of interface desired (e.g. IID_IOPCItemMgt)

	\param ppUnk
		Where to store the returned interface pointer. NULL is returned for any FAILED HRESULT.

	\retval S_OK
		The operation succeeded.

	\retval E_FAIL
		The operation failed.

	\retval E_OUTOFMEMORY
		Not enough memory.

	\retval E_INVALIDARG
		An argument to the function was invalid.

	\retval OPC_E_DUPLICATENAME
		Duplicate name not allowed.

	\retval OPC_S_UNSUPPORTEDRATE
		Server does not support specified rate,  server returns the rate that it can support in the revised update rate.

	\retval E_NOINTERFACE
		The interface(riid) asked for is not supported by the server.

	\section Behavior
		A Group is a logical container for a client to organize and manipulate data items.
		The server will create a group object, and return a pointer to the interface requested by the client. 
		If the client requests an optional interface that the server does not support, 
		the server is expected to return an error indicating the interface is not supported.
		The requested update rate / revised update rate behavior should be deterministic between client / server sessions. 
		The client expects that for the same server configuration or workspace;
		adding a group with a requested update rate will always result in the same RevisedRate independent
		of the number of clients or items that have been added.

	\section OPCServer_AddGroup_Comments Comments
		\arg The expected object lifetime behavior is as follows. Even if all the interfaces are released, 
		the group will not be deleted until RemoveGroup is called. 
		One way for the server to implement this is to assign the group an initial reference count of 2; 
		one for the 'Add' and one for the Interface that was created. However, 
		clients should not make assumptions about the Group's reference count.
		\arg The client should not call RemoveGroup without releasing all interfaces for the group. 
		The client should also not release the server without removing all private groups. 
		\arg Since the server is the 'container' for the groups it is permissible for the server 
		to forcibly remove any remaining groups at the time all of the server interfaces are released. 
		(This should not be necessary for a well behaved client).
		\arg See also the CreateGroupEnumerator function.
		\arg The level of localization supported (dwLCID) is entirely server specific.  Servers which do not support dynamic localization can ignore this parameter.
		\arg See the MoveToPublic function for additional requirements related to public groups.
		\arg The default TimeBias for the group will be that of the system in which the group is created.

		A group is not deleted when all the client interfaces are released, since the server itself maintains a reference to the group.

		\arg
		Servers which do not support public groups will simply behave as if they had no public groups. 
		That is they will NOT return E_INVALIDARG if the scope includes public groups.

		\arg
		IEnumUnknown creates an additional interface pointer to each group in the enumeration 
		(even if the client already has a connection to the group). 
		If the server has a large number of public groups available then this may involve considerable overhead 
		as well as requiring additional cleanup by the client. 
		In general, enumerating groups by name will be much faster.

		all of the returned IUnknown pointers when he is done with them.
